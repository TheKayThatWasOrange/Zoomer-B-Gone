# Zoomer-B-Gone

How many times has this happened to you?

You ordered some stupid crap on Amazon and you want to know when it will show up. You click through to the "Track package" page and it has a big fucking map covering the entire viewport. You try to scroll down to read something below it but because your cursor was hovering above the map that fills every bit of knowable space it zooms in to some ridiculous level and becomes a Mondrian mess instead of scrolling. Now you're so pissed off at technology that you forgot what the hell you were even trying to read in the first place.

If you never, ever, _ever_ want anything to zoom on any page ever then this is the extension for you. It might break something stupid somewhere, but I firmly believe that product managers who put bullshit ass scrolling effects on web pages should be kicked in the skinny jeans until their Warbly Porkers fall into their bongs full of La Croix. Add some domain filtering to the config if you disagree.

I'm not putting it in the Chrome store because I don't want a Google account. Load it up in dev mode. Assuming Figma can't sue you for reading the phrase "dev mode" yet of course.
