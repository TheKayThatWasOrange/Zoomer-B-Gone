# Zoomer-B-Gone

How many times has this happened to you?

You ordered some crap on Amazon and you want to know when it will show up. You click through to the delivery status page and it has a map on it. You try to scroll down to read something but the map zooms in to some ridiculous level and becomes completely unreadable. You also don't actually get to read the thing you were trying to scroll down to see.

If you never, ever, ever want anything to zoom on any page ever, then this is the extension for you. It might break something stupid somewhere, but I don't care.

I'm not putting it in the Chrome store because I don't want anything to do with Google. Load it up in dev mode. Assuming Figma doesn't sue you for thinking the phrase "dev mode."
