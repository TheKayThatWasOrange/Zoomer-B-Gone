# Zoomer-B-Gone

How many times has this happened to you?

You ordered some stupid crap on Amazon and you want to know when it will show up. You click through to the "Track package" page and it has a big fucking map covering the entire viewport. You try to scroll down to read something below it but because your cursor was somewhere near the map it zooms in to some ridiculous level and becomes a useless mess instead of scrolling. Now you're so pissed off at technology that you forgot what you were even looking for.

If you never, ever, ever want anything to zoom on any page ever, then this is the extension for you. It might break something stupid somewhere, but I don't care. Product managers who put scrolling effects on marcom pages should be kicked in the skinny jeans.

I'm not putting it in the Chrome store because I don't want anything to do with Google. Load it up in dev mode. Assuming Figma doesn't sue you for thinking the phrase "dev mode."
